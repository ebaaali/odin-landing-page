# odin-landing-page

Making a dummy landing page.  Really helping me practice my flex-box skills and go over other CSS I'm weak on/haven't quite committed to memory.

Emphasized the usefulness of developer tools- was stuck on moving links to the right for hours, thought to use developer tools and figured it out in about 2 minutes.  Face palm.

I've got flexbox pretty much down, but definitely could use some more practice playing with paddings and margins, specifically the automatic values.
